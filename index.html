		<aside>
			<p> Hi, I am Kyla. It is very nice to meet you. </p>
			<p> I was born in Kwa-Zulu Natal in 1997 where I grew up. Studies brought me to the beautiful Western Cape where I have been living since 2015. 
			I fell in love with the mountains and beautiful scenery offered at our very fingertips in Stellenbosch and I am so grateful to have found my home here. </p>
			<br>
			<p> I am passionate about learning and growing. It was through my job as a High School mathematics teacher that I developed a true passion for life-long learning. 
			Interacting with teenagers everyday inspired me to look for potential in each person and their circumstance. It's as if my eyes were opened to see the many opportunities given to each one of us
			on a daily basis. I learnt the value of trying and the importance to recognize that there will always be the opportunity to learn and grow. I was convicted 
			about the responsibility we each have towards our own journeys particulary in the area of work and academics. If you really want to achieve, you can by working hard and using 
			the oportunities and resources given to you. </p>
